# Wordpress Simple DB Backup Description

Wordpress Simple DB Backup is a lightweight and robust WordPress plugin designed to automatically backup your database. Schedule backups on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis and store them as ZIP-compressed files in your uploads directory. The plugin offers an intuitive admin interface for creating multiple backup jobs, triggering immediate backups, and managing your backup logsâ€”all grouped by schedule type for easy organization.

## Features

- **Flexible Scheduling:**  
  Create multiple backup jobs with options for hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups. Customize the exact time (and day, if applicable) for each backup job.

- **Immediate Backup:**  
  Trigger an immediate backup at any time with the simple "Backup Now" button.

- **ZIP Compression:**  
  All backups are compressed into ZIP files for efficient storage. Scheduled backup filenames include the backup job label and the date/time, while manual backups are named using a clean timestamp format.

- **Organized Backup Logs:**  
  View and manage your backups through a user-friendly admin panel, with logs automatically grouped by schedule type (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and manual).

- **Easy File Management:**  
  Download or delete backup files directly from the admin interface.

- **Automatic Cleanup:**  
  The plugin automatically deletes older backups once the maximum allowed number for each schedule type is reached.

## Installation

1. **Upload the Plugin:**  
   Copy the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simple-db-backup` directory, or install the plugin via the WordPress plugin installer.

2. **Activate the Plugin:**  
   Navigate to the Plugins section in your WordPress admin and activate "Simple DB Backup".

3. **Setup:**  
   Upon activation, the plugin creates a custom table for backup logs and schedules the necessary cron events.

## Usage

1. **Configure Backup Jobs:**  
   Go to the **DB Backup** menu in the WordPress admin area. Here you can add new backup jobs by specifying:
   - A custom job label.
   - The desired schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly).
   - The specific time (and day, if applicable) when the backup should run.
   - The maximum number of backups to retain for that job.

2. **Trigger Immediate Backups:**  
   Click the **Backup Now** button to perform an immediate backup.

3. **Manage Your Backups:**  
   View backup logs grouped by schedule type. Download or delete any backup file directly from the interface.

4. **Backup Storage:**  
   All backup ZIP files are saved in the `wp-content/uploads/db-backups/` directory.

## Customization

- **Filename Format:**  
  Scheduled backups use the job label (sanitized) in their filename (e.g., `backup-your-job-label-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.zip`), while manual backups are named `backup-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.zip`.

- **Further Customization:**  
  Feel free to modify the plugin code to suit your specific needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
